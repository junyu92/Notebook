### Other

means 'additional or extra', or 'alternative', or .different types of'.

**Other as a determiner**

If we use other before a singular countable noun, we must use another
determiner before it:

I don’t like the red one. I prefer **the other** colour.

**Other as a pronoun**

We have to solve this problem, more than any **other**, today.

As a pronoun, other has a plural form, **others**.

I’ll attach two photos to this email and I’ll send **others** tomorrow.

### The other

**The other as a determiner**

The other with a singular noun means the second of two things or people, or
the opposite of a set of two:

This computer here is new. **The other** computer is about five years old.

**The other as a pronoun**

We can use **the other** as a pronoun, especially to refer back to something
which has been mentioned already in the sentence:

He had his hat in one hand and a bunch of flowers in **the other**.

### Another

When we use the indefinite article an before other, we write it as one word:
another. Another means 'one more' or 'an additional or extra', or 'an
alternative or different'.

**Another as a determiner**

We use another with singular nouns:

Would you like **another** cup of coffee?

**Another as a pronoun**

The applications are examined by one committee, then passed on to **another**.
